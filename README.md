# TailoredFacilityLayout
Facility layout tailored for a two floor facility with one pre-built department and other unique parameters. Parameters are taken from "facility layout case study" which was given to me as a homework assignment (meant to be done without programming) while I was receivng my B.S. of Manufacturing Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona. This document is only for reference and as is stated on its first page and should not be duplicated. 
Program is based on the popular software/algorithm CRAFT. As with CRAFT, there is not optomization, only heuristic improvment.
